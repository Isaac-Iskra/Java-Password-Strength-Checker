# Java-Password-Strength-Checker
A program that validates the strength of a proposed password

This program prompts the user to enter a password, and then checks its strength based on length and complexity. If the password is too short or not complex enough, it will display an appropriate error message. Otherwise, it will indicate that the password is strong.

In the second method, the program checks whether it meets the following criteria:

Password length is at least 8 characters
Contains at least one lowercase letter
Contains at least one uppercase letter
Contains at least one digit
Contains at least one special character (listed as "!@#$%^&*()-+" in this example)
If the password meets all of these criteria, the program prints "Password is strong!" to the console. Otherwise, it prints "Password is weak." to the console.
