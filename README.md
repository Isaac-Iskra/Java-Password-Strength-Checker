# Java-Password-Strength-Checker
A program that validates the strength of a proposed password

This program prompts the user to enter a password, and then checks its strength based on length and complexity. If the password is too short or not complex enough, it will display an appropriate error message. Otherwise, it will indicate that the password is strong.
